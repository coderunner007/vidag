### Visualize DAG

Visualize directed acyclic graphs using d3@6.

### How to start developing/experimenting

* Prerequisites: Install npm
* Clone the repository
* Install dependencies: `npm i`
* For development: `npm run start`
* To build: `npm run build`, this will create a `dist/` folder with an `index.html` and `index.js`. Opening `index.html` in the browser will open the DAG visualization.
